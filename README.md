# basic-ann-tensorflow2-projects
This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow2.

Overview

The project walks you through building a feed-forward ANN, training it on a basic dataset, and evaluating its performance. The code is structured to be simple, modular, and well-commented, making it easy to understand and expand.

Features

Data Preparation: Loads and preprocesses data for training.

Model Building: Constructs a basic ANN with a few layers.

Training and Evaluation: Compiles, trains, and evaluates the model.

Visualization: Displays accuracy and loss trends during training.
